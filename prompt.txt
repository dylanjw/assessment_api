Background:
Here is an example of a Correlation One data science assessment:
https://quiz.correlation-one.com/test/data-scientist

The test taker:
1) fills out basic contact information (first_name, last_name, email)
2) gets assigned a unique assessment instance / session (ex.
1d4c9d2b-86d9-4813-a831-dd2bcca9fe96)
3) gets assessment questions
4) submits assessment answers
5) Gets a confirmation when the final assessment has been submitted
**Note:
- The assessment session is timed (counting down from 1hr)
- The assessment session can be continued from another browser window
- Some of the contents of the question (either body or answer choices) are not
simply text (some are html, img, etc.)

Your Goal:
In any language you’d like, recreate a backend (DB and API) that would satisfy
the basic interaction outlined above. Feel free to deviate/improve upon the exact
request/response patterns we currently use. The API should return JSON and
will be tested with Postman. Along with your submission should be a github
repository, instructions to setup and run locally, and instructions to run any
included test suite.

Tip: Feel free to take the linked assessment as many times as you’d like and take
a peek at the networking tab of Chrome's developer panel to see our current
request/response payload structure.
Spend as much time on this as you are willing to. We understand many
candidates are interviewing at multiple companies simultaneously, so we don’t
expect you to dedicate all of your time to just one.
If you’re unable to get this challenge to a satisfactory place within a reasonable
amount of time, write up a summary of your progress so far, including how you’d
complete it if you had more time. Then submit that along with the code
